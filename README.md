# Java Loop Bug: Premature Termination

This repository demonstrates a common error in Java where the `break` statement is used inside a loop, causing it to terminate early. This can result in incomplete processing or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version. The problem highlights the importance of carefully considering the conditions and flow control within loops.
